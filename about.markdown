Welcome to my personal website! Iâ€™m a university student with a focus on embedded systems development. This site serves as a space to share my thoughts, projects, and learning journey, particularly in the areas of embedded programming, hardware integration, and open-source contributions.

As an aspiring embedded systems engineer, I am passionate about understanding how software and hardware interact, and how to build efficient and reliable solutions. From working with microcontrollers to developing embedded firmware, I enjoy tackling challenges that require both creativity and technical skills.

I also love documenting my experiences, sharing tutorials, and publishing technical articles to help others in the community. If you're interested in my work or have any questions, feel free to reach out through the contact page. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my projects inspiring!
